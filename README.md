Loops and Mask residuals in the Cosmic Microwave Background

Student: Adnan Jasarevic
Mentors: James Creswell, Amel Durakovic

The purpose of this project was to *investigate the statistics of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization*. The first part of the project consisted of understanding the effects of masking on polarization and implementing a known method to remove these effects. In the second part, a new approach was formulated to search for the presence of loop correlations in the CMB.

Apart from standard libraries **numpy** and **matplotlib**, this project required the use of **healpy**, a python package used for handling the pixelated data on the sphere.
